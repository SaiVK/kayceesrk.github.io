I am chairing the PC for ML family workshop this year. The PC is happy to invite
submissions for the workshop to be held during the ICFP conference week on
Thursday 22nd August 2019.

ML family workshop invites submissions touching on the programming languages
traditionally seen as part of the “ML family”. However, we are also keen to
receive submissions from other related language groups. If you have questions
about the suitability of your work for the workshop, please feel free to write
an email.
